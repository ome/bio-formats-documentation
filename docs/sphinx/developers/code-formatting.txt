Code formatting
===============

Note, these guidelines do not cover:

- third-party code imported into the source tree, which is covered by
  the guidelines for the upstream projects
- released schema files which would require re-releasing if changed by
  reindenting

All languages

- Use spaces to indent; do not ever use tabs

- an indentation size of two spaces
- braces use the `Java variant of K&R style
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_Java>`__

XML
---

All XML code is formatted with:

- an indentation size of two spaces
- attributes on multiple lines aligned vertically after the element name.
