Scripts for performing common code updates
==========================================

The :code:`tools` directory contains several scripts which are useful
for performing routine updates to the code base.

bump_maven_version.py
---------------------

This updates the Maven POM version numbers for all pom.xml files that
set `groupId` to `ome`.  The script takes a single argument, which is the new
version.  For example, to update the POM versions prior to release::

  ./tools/bump_maven_version.py 5.1.0

and to switch back to snapshot versions immediately after release::

  ./tools/bump_maven_version.py 5.1.1-SNAPSHOT

update_copyright
----------------

This updates the end year in the copyright blocks of all source code files.
The command takes no arguments, and sets the end year to be the current year.
As `update_copyright` is a Bash script, it is not intended to be run on
Windows.
