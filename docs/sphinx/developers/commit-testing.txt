Testing code changes
====================

Automated tests
---------------

At the bottom of many commit messages in
https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats, you will find a few lines
similar to this:

::

    To test, please run:

    ant -Dtestng.directory=$DATA/metamorph test-automated

This shows the command(s) necessary to run automated tests against the
files likely to be affected by that commit. If you want to run these
tests, you will need to do the following:

Clone bioformats.git and checkout the appropriate branch (by following
the directions on the :devs_doc:`Git usage <using-git.html>`
page). Run this command to build all of the JAR files:

::

    $ ant clean jars

Switch to the test-suite component:

::

    $ cd components/test-suite

Run the tests, where $DATA is the path to the full data repository:

::

    $ ant -Dtestng.directory=$DATA/metamorph test-automated

On Windows, the arguments to the test command must be quoted:

::

    > ant "-Dtestng.directory=$DATA\metamorph" test-automated

By default, 512 MB of memory are allocated to the JVM. You can increase
this by adding the '-Dtestng.memory=XXXm' option. You should now see
output similar to this:

::

    Buildfile: build.xml

    init-title:
         [echo] ----------=========== bio-formats-testing-framework ===========----------

    init-timestamp:

    release-version:

    init-manifest-cp:

    init:

    copy-source:

    compile:

    test-automated:
       [testng] [Parser] Running:
       [testng]   Bio-Formats software test suite
       [testng]
       [testng] Scanning for files...
       [testng] Building list of tests...
       [testng] Ready to test 490 files
       [testng] ........................................

and then eventually:

::

       [testng] ===============================================
       [testng] Bio-Formats software test suite
       [testng] Total tests run: 19110, Failures: 0, Skips: 0
       [testng] ===============================================
       [testng]

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 16 minutes 42 seconds

Each of the dots represents a single passed test; a '-' is a skipped
test, and an 'F' is a failed test. This is mostly just for your
amusement if you happen to be staring at the console while the tests
run, as a more detailed report is logged to
:file:`bio-formats-software-test-$DATE.log`
(where "$DATE" is the date on which the tests
started in "yyyy-MM-dd_hh-mm-ss" format).

If Ant reports that the build was successful, then there is nothing that
you need to do. Otherwise, it is helpful if you can provide the command,
branch name, number of failures at the bottom of the Ant output, and the
:file:`bio-formats-software-test-\*.log` file.

MATLAB tests
------------
.. _matlab-xunit: https://github.com/psexton/matlab-xunit

Tests for the Bio-Formats MATLAB toolbox are written using the xunit framework
and located under :sourcedir:`components/formats-gpl/test/matlab`.

To run these tests, you will need to download or clone `matlab-xunit`_, a
xUnit framework with JUnit-compatible XML output. Then add this package
together with the Bio-Formats MATLAB to your MATLAB path:

.. code-block:: matlab

  % Add the matlab-xunit toolbox to the MATLAB path
  addpath('/path/to/matlab-xunit');
  % Add the Bio-Formats MATLAB source to the MATLAB path
  % For developers working against the source code
  addpath('/path/to/bioformats/components/formats-gpl/matlab');
  addpath('/path/to/bioformats/artifacts');
  % For developers working against a built artifact, e.g. a release
  % addpath('/path/to/bfmatlab');

You can run all the MATLAB tests using :command:`runxunit`:

.. code-block:: matlab

  cd /path/to/bioformats/components/formats-gpl/test/matlab
  runxunit

Individual test classes can be run by passing the name of the class:

.. code-block:: matlab

  cd /path/to/bioformats/components/formats-gpl/test/matlab
  runxunit TestBfsave

Individual test methods can be run by passing the name of the class and the
name of the method:

.. code-block:: matlab

  cd /path/to/bioformats/components/formats-gpl/test/matlab
  runxunit TestBfsave:testLZW

Finally to output the test results under XML format, you can use the :option:`-xmlfile` option:

.. code-block:: matlab

  cd /path/to/bioformats/components/formats-gpl/test/matlab
  runxunit -xmlfile test-output.xml
