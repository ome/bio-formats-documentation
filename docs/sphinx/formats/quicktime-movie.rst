**Additional Information**


Bio-Formats has two modes of operation for QuickTime: 

* The legacy QTJava mode requires QuickTime for Java which will only run 
  with a 32-bit JVM and is no longer available from Apple. 
* Native mode works on systems with no QuickTime (e.g. Linux). 

Bio-Formats can save image stacks as QuickTime movies.
