Grouping files using a pattern file
===================================

Individual files can be grouped together into a single fileset using a pattern
file.  This works for any single-file format that Bio-Formats supports, as
long as all files are in the same format.  It is most useful for sets of TIFF,
JPEG, PNG, etc. files that do not have any associated metadata.

All files to be grouped together should be in the same folder.  The pattern
file should be in the same folder as the other files; it can have any name,
but must have the `.pattern` extension.  The pattern file is what must be
opened or imported, so it may be helpful to give it a descriptive or
easily-recognizable name.

The pattern file contains a single line of text that is specially formatted to
describe how the files should be grouped.  The file can be created in any text
editor.

The text in the pattern file can take one of several forms.  To illustrate,
consider a folder with the following file names:

::

  red.tiff
  green.tiff
  blue.tiff
  test_Z0_C0.png
  test_Z1_C0.png
  test_Z0_C1.png
  test_Z1_C1.png
  test_Z0_C2.png
  test_Z1_C2.png

A pattern file that groups `red.tiff`, `green.tiff`, and `blue.tiff` in that
order would look like:

::

  <red,green,blue>.tiff

A pattern that groups test_Z0_C0.png, test_Z1_C0.png, test_Z0_C2.png, and
test_Z1_C2.png:

::

  test_Z<0-1>_C<0-2:1>.png

The `<>` notation in general can accept a single literal value, a
comma-separate list of literal values, a range of integer values, or a range
of integer values with a step value greater than 1 (the range and step are
separated by `:`).

A pattern file that groups all PNG files beginning with `test_` would look like:

::

  test_.*.png

This and most other Java-style regular expressions can be used in place of the
`<>` notation above.  See `the java.util.regex.Pattern Javadoc
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html>`_
for more information on constructing regular expressions.
