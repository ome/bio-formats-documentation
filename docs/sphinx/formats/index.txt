Formats
=======

Bio-Formats supports over 120 different file formats. The 
:doc:`/supported-formats` table lists all of these and gives an indication of
how well they are supported and whether Bio-Formats can write, as well as 
read, each format. The :doc:`dataset-table` explains the file extension you 
should choose to open/import a dataset in any of these formats.
