LAS stands for "Leica Application Suite". 
AF stands for "Advanced Fluorescence". 

Commercial applications that support LIF include:

* `SVI Huygens <http://svi.nl/>`_ 
* `Amira <http://www.amira.com/>`_ 

Versions of Bio-Formats prior to 5.3.3 incorrectly calculated the physical 
pixel width and height.  The physical image width and height were divided by 
the number of pixels, which was inconsistent with the official Leica LIF 
specification documents.  Versions 5.3.3 and later correctly calculate 
physical pixel sizes by dividing the physical image size by the number of 
pixels minus one.  To revert to the old method of physical pixel size 
calculation in 5.3.3 and later, set the ``leicalif.old_physical_size`` option 
to ``true`` as described in :doc:`options`.
