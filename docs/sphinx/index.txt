Bio-Formats Documentation
#########################

Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing life
sciences image file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and
metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several
formats. See the :doc:`Supported Formats <loci/bio-formats-formats>`
page for a complete list and information on the level of support
(click the format names to see all information).

Bio-Formats's primary purpose is to convert proprietary microscopy data into
an open standard called the `OME data model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, 
particularly into the OME-TIFF_file format. See 
:doc:`the Goal of Bio-Formats <loci/bio-formats-about>` for more information about how
Bio-formats processes metadata and the rationale behind the project.
