Troubleshooting
===============

This page is aimed at anyone who is responsible for supporting
Bio-Formats, but may also be useful for advanced users looking to
troubleshoot their own problems. Eventually, it might be best to move
some of this to the FAQ or other documentation.


-  Make sure to ask for a \_specific\_ error message or description of
   the unexpected behavior, if one is not provided ("it does not work"
   is obviously not adequate).
-  "My (12, 14, 16)-bit images look all black when I open them" is a
   common issue. In ImageJ/Fiji, this is almost always fixable by
   checking the "Autoscale" option; with the command line tools, the
   "-autoscale -fast" options should work. The problem is typically that
   the pixel values are very, very small relative to the maximum
   possible pixel value (4095, 16383, and 65535, respectively), so when
   displayed the pixels are effectively black.
-  If the file is very, very small (4096 bytes) and any exception is
   generated when reading the file, then make sure it is not a `Mac OS
   X resource
   fork <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork#The_Macintosh_file_system>`_.
   The 'file' command should tell you:

   ::

       $ file /path/to/suspicious-file
       suspicious-file: AppleDouble encoded Macintosh file




Tips by format
--------------

3I/Olympus Slidebook (.sld)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Slidebook support is generally not great, despite a lot of effort.
   This is the one format for which it is recommended to just export to
   OME-TIFF from the acquisition software and work with the exported
   files. Happily, there is free software from 3I which can do the
   export post-acquisition:
   `https://www.slidebook.com/reader.php <https://www.slidebook.com/reader.php>`_

DICOM
~~~~~

-  Health care or institutional regulations often prevent users from
   sending problematic files, so often we have to solve the problem
   blind. In these cases, it is important to get the exact error message,
   and inform the user that fixing the problem may be an iterative
   process (i.e. they might have to try a couple of trunk builds before
   we can finally fix the problem).

ZVI
~~~

-  If the ZVI reader plugin is installed in ImageJ/Fiji, then it will be
   used instead of Bio-Formats to read ZVI files. To check if this is
   the cause of the problem, make sure that the file opens correctly
   using "Plugins > Bio-Formats > Bio-Formats Importer"; if that works, then
   just remove ZVI\_Reader.class from the plugins folder.
