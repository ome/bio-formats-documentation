Reporting a bug
===============

Before filing a bug report
--------------------------

If you think you have found a bug in Bio-Formats, the first thing to do is
update your version of Bio-Formats to the latest version to check if the
problem has already been addressed. The Fiji updater will automatically do
this for you, while in ImageJ you can select
:menuselection:`Plugins --> Bio-Formats --> Update Bio-Formats Plugins`.

You can also download the :downloads:`latest version of Bio-Formats <>`.
If you are not sure which version you need, select the latest build of the
Bio-Formats package bundle from the components table.

Sending a bug report
--------------------

If you can still reproduce the bug after updating to the latest version
of Bio-Formats, please send a bug report to the
:mailinglist:`OME Users mailing list <ome-users>`. You can upload files to our
`QA system <http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk/qa/upload/>`_ or for large files
(>2 GB), we can provide you with an FTP server address if you write to the
mailing list.

To ensure that any inquiries you make are resolved promptly, please include
the following information:

-  **Exact error message**. Copy and paste any error messages into the
   text of your email. Alternatively, attach a screenshot of the
   relevant windows.
-  **Version information**. Indicate which release of Bio-Formats, which
   operating system, and which version of Java you are using.
-  **Non-working data**. If possible, please send a non-working file.
   This helps us ensure that the problem is fixed for next release and
   will not reappear in later releases. Note that any data
   provided is used for internal testing only; we do not make images
   publicly available unless given explicit permission to do so.
-  **Metadata and screenshots**. If possible, include any additional
   information about your data. We are especially interested in the
   expected dimensions (width, height, number of channels, Z slices, and
   timepoints). Screenshots of the image being successfully opened in
   other software are also useful.
-  **Format details**. If you are requesting support for a new format,
   we ask that you send as much data as you have regarding this format
   (sample files, specifications, vendor/manufacturer information,
   etc.). This helps us to better support the format and ensures future
   versions of the format are also supported.

**Please be patient** - it may be a few days until you receive a
response, but we reply to *every* email inquiry we receive.
