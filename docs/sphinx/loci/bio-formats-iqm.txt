Iqm
===

`Iqm <http://code.google.com/p/iqm/>`_ is an image processing
application written in Java. It is mainly constructed around the Java
JAI library and furthermore it incorporates the functionality of the
popular ImageJ image processing software.

Because iqm integrates with ImageJ, it can take advantage of the
`Bio-Formats ImageJ plugin </bio-formats/imagej>`_ to read image data.
