Source code
===========

--------------

If you are interested in the latest Bio-Formats source code from our
`Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ repository, you can access it using the
repository path:

    git@github.com:openmicroscopy/bioformats.git

You can also browse the Bio-Formats source in two ways:

-  The `OME Trac
   server <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/browser/bioformats.git>`_,
   which we use for project management, including tasks, milestones and
   known issues
-  `GitHub <http://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats>`_

 

To build the code, you can use our Ant build script—try "``ant -p``\ "
for a list of targets.  In general, "ant jars" or "ant tools" is the
correct command.

Lastly, you can `browse the Bio-Formats Javadocs
online <http://hudson.openmicroscopy.org.uk/job/BIOFORMATS-trunk/javadoc/>`_,
or generate them yourself using the "docs" Ant target.
