MATLAB
======

`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ is a high-level
language and interactive environment that facilitates rapid development
of algorithms for performing computationally intensive tasks.

Calling Bio-Formats from MATLAB is fairly straightforward, since MATLAB
has built-in interoperability with Java. We have created a simple script
for reading image files:

    `bfopen.m <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/browser/bioformats.git/components/bio-formats/utils/bfopen.m?format=txt>`_

We are not MATLAB expertsâ€”any comments on improving the script are
welcome.

Performance
-----------

In our tests (MATLAB R14 vs. java 1.6.0\_20), the script executes at
approximately half the speed of our `showinf command line
tool </bio-formats/command-line-tools>`_, due to overhead from copying
arrays.

Installation
------------

To use the script, download **bfopen.m** (above) and
`**loci\_tools.jar** </bio-formats/downloads>`_ and place them in your
MATLAB work directory.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite **loci\_tools.jar**
with the `newer version </bio-formats/downloads>`_ and restart MATLAB.
