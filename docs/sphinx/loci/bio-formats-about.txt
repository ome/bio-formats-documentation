About
=====

The primary goal of Bio-Formats is to facilitate the exchange of
microscopy data between both different software packages and different
organizations. It accomplishes this goal by converting proprietary
microscopy data into an open standard called the `OME data
model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, particularly into the
`OME-TIFF <http://ome-xml.org/wiki/OmeTiff>`_ file format.

We believe the standardization of microscopy metadata to a common
structure is of vital importance to the community. See **The benefits of
standardization** below for a detailed rationale, or **A brief overview
of metadata** further down for more information on how Bio-Formats
processes metadata.

The benefits of standardization
-------------------------------

The adoption of standards in the microscopy community—and within
computing in general—is of massive benefit to both individual scientists
and commercial and academic organizations. A brief `article on the
benefits of
standardization <http://www.thinkstandards.net/benefits.html>`_ from
`thinkstandards.net <http://www.thinkstandards.net/>`_ provides an
excellent summary:

    An extensive study initiated by DIN (German Standards Institute) and
    the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Technology in
    1997 was completed in May 2000. The study provides detailed insight
    into the economic benefits for standards—to businesses and to the
    economy. Highlights of the study include:

    -  Standards contribute more to economic growth than patents and
       licenses
    -  Standards play a strategic significance to companies
    -  Companies that participate actively in standards work have a head
       start on their competitors in adapting to market demands
    -  Research risks and development costs are reduced for companies
       contributing to the standardization process
    -  Business that are actively involved in standards work more
       frequently reap short and long term benefits with regard to costs
       and competitive status than those who do not participate
    -  Participating in standards development enables one to anticipate
       technology standardization thereby facilitating one's products
       progress simultaneously with technology
    -  Leaders in technology should become more involved in standards
    -  Standards are a positive stimulus for innovation
    -  Standards are internationally respected

A brief overview of metadata
----------------------------

Pixels in microscopy are almost always very straightforward, stored on
evenly spaced rectangular grids. It is the metadata—details about the
acquisition, experiment, user, and other information—that can be
complex. Using the OME data model enables applications to support a
single metadata format, rather than the multitude of proprietary formats
in the wild today. In addition, those that directly leverage the
Bio-Formats library can transparently support dozens of proprietary
formats with no extra effort per format.

Every file format has a distinct set of metadata, stored differently.
Bio-Formats processes and converts each format's metadata structures
into a standard form called the `OME data
model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, according to the
`OME-XML <http://ome-xml.org/>`_ specification. We have defined an open
exchange format called `OME-TIFF <http://ome-xml.org/wiki/OmeTiff>`_
that stores its metadata as OME-XML. Any software package that supports
OME-TIFF is also compatible with the dozens of formats listed on the
Bio-Formats page, because you can use Bio-Formats to convert your files
to OME-TIFF format.

To facilitate support of OME-XML, we have created a `library in
Java <http://ome-xml.org/wiki/OmeXmlJava>`_ for reading and writing
OME-XML metadata.

There are three types of metadata in Bio-Formats, which we call core
metadata, original metadata, and OME metadata.

#. "Core metadata" only includes those things necessary to understand
   the basic structure of the pixels: image resolution; number of focal
   planes, time points, channels, and other dimensional axes; byte
   order; dimension order; color arrangement (RGB, indexed color or
   separate channels); and thumbnail resolution.
#. "Original metadata" corresponds to information specific to a
   particular file format. These fields are key/value pairs in the
   original format, with no guarantee of cross-format naming consistency
   or compatibility. Nomenclature often differs between formats, as each
   vendor is free to use their own terminology.
#. "OME metadata" is information from #1 and #2 converted by Bio-Formats
   into the OME data model. **Performing this conversion is the primary
   purpose of Bio-Formats.** Bio-Formats uses its ability to convert
   proprietary metadata into OME-XML as part of its integration with the
   OME and OMERO servers— essentially, they are able to populate their
   databases in a structured way because Bio-Formats sorts the metadata
   into the proper places. This conversion is nowhere near complete or
   bug free, but we are constantly working to improve it. We would
   greatly appreciate any and all input from users concerning missing or
   improperly converted metadata fields.

We are working on a "Bio-Formats metadata guide" document detailing
these three kinds of metadata and how the Bio-Formats metadata API
works. Although it is far from complete, with many unwritten sections,
you can find a `draft in the Git
repository <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/browser/bioformats.git/components/bio-formats/doc/metadata-guide.txt>`_.

We have tried to provide a lot of developer documentation on this site
regarding how to use the Bio-Formats library, and link it all in a
cohesive way from the Bio-Formats page. If you find that anything is
missing or unclear, please do not hesitate to contact us.
