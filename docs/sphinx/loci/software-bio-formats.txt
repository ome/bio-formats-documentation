Bio-Formats
===========

Overview
--------

Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing life
sciences image file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and
metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several
formats. See the table below for a complete list (click the format names
to see all information). For more information on
the format ratings, see the :doc:`Supported Formats <bio-formats-formats>`
page.

Purpose
-------

Bio-Formats's primary purpose is to convert proprietary microscopy data into
an open standard called the `OME data model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, particularly into the OME-TIFF_
file format. See the
:doc:`Bio-Formats statement of purpose <bio-formats-about>` for a thorough
explanation and rationale.

For developers
--------------

You can :doc:`use Bio-Formats as a library <bio-formats-bio-formats-java-library>` to easily support
these formats in your software.
