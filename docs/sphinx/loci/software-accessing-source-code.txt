Accessing Source Code
=====================

--------------

If you are interested in the latest source code from our
`Subversion <http://subversion.apache.org/>`_ repository, you can check
it out using the repository path:

    http://dev.loci.wisc.edu/svn/software/trunk

We also have a `Trac server <http://dev.loci.wisc.edu/trac/software/>`_
for project management, including tasks, milestones and known issues.

If you are unfamiliar with Subversion, read the `Initial
Checkout <http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.tour.initial.html>`_
and `Basic Work
Cycle <http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.tour.cycle.html>`_
sections of the online `Subversion
book <http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/>`_ for a primer. If you use
Windows and want a graphical Subversion client, try
`TortoiseSVN <http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/>`_.

If you use the `Eclipse SDK <http://www.eclipse.org/>`_ for development,
you can use the `Subclipse <http://subclipse.tigris.org/>`_ plugin to
import the LOCI Software project by choosing File > Import... from the
menu and selecting "Checkout Projects from SVN" under the "Other"
heading. After doing so, the project should build successfully with no
further configuration (though please note that seeing hundreds of
non-fatal warnings is normal). Alternately, if you check out the code
with an external tool such as TortoiseSVN, you can import the project
into Eclipse afterward using the "Existing Projects into Workspace"
import option under the "General" heading.

If you have `Ant <http://ant.apache.org/>`_ installed, you can make use
of our Ant build scriptâ€”try "``ant -p``\ " for a list of targets.

Lastly, you can `browse the online
Javadocs <http://dev.loci.wisc.edu:8080/job/LOCI/javadoc/>`_ for all our
Java software, or generate them yourself using the "docs" Ant target.
