Installing Bio-Formats in ImageJ
================================


.. note:: Since FIJI is essentially ImageJ with plugins like Bio-Formats
    already built in, people who install Fiji can skip this section.
    
    If you are also using the OMERO plugin for ImageJ, you may find the set-up
    guide on the new `user help site
    <http://help.openmicroscopy.org/imagej.html>`_ useful
    for getting you started with both plugins at the same time.

Once you `download <http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html>`__ and
install ImageJ, you can install the Bio-Formats plugin by going to the
Bio-Formats :downloads:`download page <>` and saving the
**bioformats\_package.jar** to the Plugins directory within ImageJ.

    should place the file once you downloaded it.

You may have to quit and restart ImageJ. Once you restart it, you will
find Bio-Formats in the Bio-Formats option under the Plugins menu:
