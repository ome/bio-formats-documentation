Micro-Manager
=============

`Micro-Manager <https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager>`_ is a
software framework for implementing advanced and novel imaging procedures,
extending functionality, customization and rapid development of specialized
imaging applications.

Micro-Manager offers the functionality for saving the acquired images in
TIFF/OME-TIFF format. Based on the mode of saving and the configuration
settings, the acquired image can be saved with or without a companion file
(:file:`*metadata.txt`):

``*`` Not all acquisition metadata is converted to OME-XML.

``**`` A small change in the acquisition side facilitates better handling of
the metadata from the Bio-Formats side:
:menuselection:`Tools --> Options...` and then select "Create metadata.txt
file with Image Stack Files" in the text box.
