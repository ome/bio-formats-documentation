Validating XML in an OME-TIFF
=============================

The XML stored in an OME-TIFF file can be validated using the
:doc:`command line tools <index>`.

Both the ``tiffcomment`` and ``xmlvalid`` commands are used; ``tiffcomment``
extracts the XML from the file and ``xmlvalid`` validates the XML and prints
any errors to the console.

For example:

::

  tiffcomment /path/to/file.ome.tiff | xmlvalid -

will perform the extraction and validation all at once.

If the XML is found to have validation errors, the ``tiffcomment`` command can
be used to overwrite the XML in the OME-TIFF file with corrected XML.
The XML can be displayed in an editor window:

::

  tiffcomment -edit /path/to/file.ome.tiff

or the new XML can be read from a file:

::

  tiffcomment -set new-comment.xml /path/to/file.ome.tiff
