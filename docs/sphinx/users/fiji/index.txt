Fiji overview
=============

`Fiji <http://fiji.sc/>`_ is an image processing package. It
can be described as a distribution of :doc:`ImageJ </users/imagej/index>`
together with Java, Java 3D and a lot of plugins organized into a
`coherent menu
structure <http://fiji.sc/Plugins_Menu>`_.
Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux.

Fiji works with Bio-Formats out of the box, because it comes bundled
with the :doc:`Bio-Formats ImageJ plugins </users/imagej/index>`.

For further details on Bio-Formats in Fiji, see the
`Bio-Formats Fiji wiki page <http://fiji.sc/Bio-Formats>`_.

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading Bio-Formats within Fiji is as simple as invoking the "Update
Fiji" command from the Help menu. By default, Fiji even automatically
checks for updates every time it is launched, so you will always be
notified when new versions of Bio-Formats (or any other bundled plugin)
are available.

8) To Check Version of Bio-Formats : Select Help > About Plugins > Bio-Formats Plugins...
Check that the version of Bio-Formats matches the freshly downloaded version.
9) Start Fiji and open any Image file using "Plugins > Bio-Formats > Bio-Formats Importer".

Note : It is vital to perform all of those steps in order; omitting even one will cause a problem. In particular, make sure that the old files are fully removed; it is not sufficient to add the new files to any sub-directory without removing the old files first.
