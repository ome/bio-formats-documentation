Fiji overview
=============

`Fiji <http://fiji.sc/>`_ is an image processing package. It
can be described as a distribution of :doc:`ImageJ </users/imagej/index>`
together with Java, Java 3D and a lot of plugins organized into a
`coherent menu
structure <http://fiji.sc/Plugins_Menu>`_.
Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux.

Fiji works with Bio-Formats out of the box, because it comes bundled
with the :doc:`Bio-Formats ImageJ plugins </users/imagej/index>`.

For further details on Bio-Formats in Fiji, see the
`Bio-Formats Fiji wiki page <http://fiji.sc/Bio-Formats>`_.

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading Bio-Formats within Fiji is as simple as invoking the "Update
Fiji" command from the Help menu. By default, Fiji even automatically
checks for updates every time it is launched, so you will always be
notified when new versions of Bio-Formats (or any other bundled plugin)
are available.
